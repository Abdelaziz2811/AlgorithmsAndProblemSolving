## 🧩 C++ Algorithms and Problem Solving

## 📝 Project Description

This repository is my personal journey in learning and implementing algorithms, data structures, and solving programming problems using C++. As I learn and grow, I'll be adding my solutions, implementations, and insights.

## 🚀 Current Status

**🔨 Work in Progress**
- Just started building the repository
- Gradually adding solutions and implementations
- Learning and documenting my problem-solving approach

## 📂 Planned Structure

```
cpp-algorithms/
│
├── data_structures/
├── algorithms/
├── problem_solving/
└── notes/
```

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn and implement various algorithms
- Improve C++ programming skills
- Document my learning process
- Create a personal reference for algorithms and problem-solving techniques

## 🛠 Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have:
   - A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
   - CMake (optional, but recommended)
